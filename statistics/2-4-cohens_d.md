[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)
Exercise 2.4 Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first ba- bies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

The mean weight for first born babies is 7.2 lbs, and others 7.32 lbs. The Cohen's d coefficient is computed as -0.088, showing that the difference in weight for first born/other babies is small. The weight difference is only slightly larger than for pregnancy length, with a Cohen's: d = 0.028.
