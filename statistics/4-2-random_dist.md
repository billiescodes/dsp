[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution) <br>
**Exercise 4.2** The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Click on the images to see PMF and CDF of 1000 random numbers (generated using np.random.random ) between (0,1). 
The PMF image shows that the generated distribution is uniform. The CDF shows a straight line.

<img src=../img/ch4-2-fig2_CDF.pdf>

If only 10 numbers are generated, as can be seen in the following plot, the PMF is a better metric for the uniformity of the distribution. The CDF is not straight, or useful. The smoothness of the CDF line should improve with sample size.
