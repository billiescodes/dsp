For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

###Q1. Lists &amp; Tuples

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?
>
A list, or an array, is an ordered sequence of values, where the values can be any type (int, float, string). A tuple is an immutable list.

Because Dictionary use hash tables to store key-value pairs, the keys have to be immutable. Only tuples can be used as keys in a dictionary.

###Q2. Lists &amp; Sets

How are Python lists and sets similar and different? Give examples of using both. How does performance compare between lists and sets for finding an element. Why?

>> Both lists and sets are ordered sequences of values. The difference is that lists may contain redundant values, while sets only contain unique values.

###Q3. Lambda Function

Describe Python's `lambda`. What is it, and what is it used for? Give at least one example, including an example of using a `lambda` in the `key` argument to `sorted`.

> Lambda is an anonymys function that lives inside methods. It is used to perform a quick action without explicitly writing a definition.

```python
>>> a = [1, 27,3, 5, 112, 2]
>>> sorted(a, key = lambda x : x, reverse=True)
[112, 27, 5, 3, 2, 1]
```

###Q4. List Comprehension, Map &amp; Filter

Explain list comprehensions. Give examples and show equivalents with `map` and `filter`. How do their capabilities compare? Also demonstrate set comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.

###Complete the following problems by editing the files below:

###Q5. Datetime
Use Python to compute days between start and stop date.   
a.  

```
date_start = '01-02-2013'    
date_stop = '07-28-2015'
```

>> 937 days


b.  
```
date_start = '12312013'  
date_stop = '05282015'  
```

>> 513 days


c.  
```
date_start = '15-Jan-1994'      
date_stop = '14-Jul-2015'  
```

>> 7850 days
